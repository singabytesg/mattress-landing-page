    question: "Why are showroom prices cheaper than online?",
    answer: "We offer exclusive showroom prices to reward customers who visit us in person. This allows us to provide personalized service, let you try all our mattresses, and often results in bundle deals with our furniture collections - savings that can exceed 40% off regular prices."
  },
  {
    question: "How does the 100-night trial work?",
    answer: "After purchasing from our showroom, we deliver your mattress for free. You have 100 nights to sleep on it at home. If you're not completely satisfied, we'll pick it up at no charge and provide a full refund. No questions asked, no hidden fees."
  },
  {
    question: "What makes ESSEN mattresses suitable for Singapore's climate?",
    answer: "Our mattresses feature cooling gel technology, breathable materials, and anti-microbial protection specifically designed for tropical humidity. The open-cell structure promotes airflow while silver-ion technology prevents mold and dust mites common in our climate."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I buy online and pick up at the showroom?",
    answer: "While you can browse our collection online, all purchases must be completed at our showroom to receive the exclusive pricing. This ensures you get personalized service and the best possible deal. You can book an appointment online for faster service."
  },
  {
    question: "What's included in the free delivery?",
    answer: "Free delivery includes: transportation to your home, carrying the mattress to your bedroom (including stairs), professional setup, plastic removal, and optional removal of your old mattress. We deliver island-wide in Singapore within 3-5 days."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer financing options?",
    answer: "Yes! We offer 0% interest installment plans for 6 or 12 months with major credit cards. We also accept PayNow, cash, and checks. Speak to our showroom consultants about the best payment option for you."
