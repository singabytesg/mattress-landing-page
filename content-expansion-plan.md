### 1.1 Product-Level Sleep Position Guidance

#### ESSEN Ultra Plus - Sleep Position Matrix

**Primary Recommendation: Back & Combination Sleepers**

**Sleep Position Breakdown:**

**✅ EXCELLENT FOR:**
- **Back Sleepers (Score: 9/10)**
  - Why: Medium-firm support maintains natural spinal alignment
  - CoolFlow™ HD foam provides pressure relief without excess sinking
  - PocketGuard™ springs support lumbar region
  - Recommendation: "Ideal for back sleepers who need balanced support"

- **Combination Sleepers (Score: 8.5/10)**
  - Why: Responsive foam layer allows easy position changes
  - Spring system adapts to different positions throughout night
  - Not too soft, not too firm - versatile support
  - Recommendation: "Perfect for those who shift positions frequently"

**⚠️ GOOD FOR:**
- **Side Sleepers - Light to Medium Build (Score: 7/10)**
  - Why: CoolFlow™ HD provides adequate pressure relief for shoulders/hips
  - May be slightly firm for heavier side sleepers
  - Best for: Side sleepers under 80kg
  - Recommendation: "Suitable for lighter-weight side sleepers seeking support"

**❌ NOT RECOMMENDED FOR:**
- **Pure Stomach Sleepers (Score: 5/10)**
  - Why: Medium-firm may create slight pressure on lower back
  - Better option: Consider Ultra Max with adjustable pillow
  - Alternative: Place pillow under pelvis for stomach sleeping

- **Heavy Side Sleepers (90kg+) (Score: 6/10)**
